### Projects

[Airbnb Berlin](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirbnbBerlin_17090407314950/AirbnbBerlin?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link){:target="_blank"} 

Market research for Airbnb in Berlin utilizing supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and geospatial analysis with Python and Tableau. I couldn’t find a clear relationship between price and the other available variables in the data. Still, I created an interactive map to facilitate prospective Airbnb users and host a complete picture of the market in Berlin. Filtering by property type, features, and neighborhood, they can check the average price of the
accommodations.

The characteristics of this project required a deep understanding of Python and libraries such as Bokeh, Plotly, Dash, Folium, Geopandas, Geoplot, and scikit-learn. The scripts and visualizations created with Python are available for reference in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vanessanunezp/Geospatial_Analysis_Project){:target="_blank"}. It is also an excellent example of the importance of cleaning and understanding the data as a starting point for every analysis.

[Instacart](https://github.com/vanessanunezp/Ecommerce_Buying_Patterns_Project){:target="_blank"} 

For this project, I conducted all the stages of my analysis to identify the correlation between customer buying behavior and e-commerce marketing strategy with Python in Jupyter Notebook, using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Thanks to this approach, I could derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation to ensure Instacart when to schedule more ads to promote what products to whom, considering different customer profiles.

[Influenza Season in the U.S.](https://public.tableau.com/views/RecommendationsfortheInfluenzaSeasoninU_S_/StaffPlan?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link){:target="_blank"} 

This project aimed to assign key medical staff strategically ahead of the flu season using Excel and Tableau for data visualization. All the process and the corresponding analysis and findings are consolidated in an Interim Report available for consultation in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vanessanunezp/Staffing_Distribution){:target="_blank"}, and the final storyboard is in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RecommendationsfortheInfluenzaSeasoninU_S_/StaffPlan?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link){:target="_blank"}.

The big challenge of this project was integrating the different available data sets into one, mainly because the values were not uniform. So, I started creating a data profile for each data set and implemented data quality measures to ensure optimal data integration into one cohesive data set. Then, the descriptive analysis helped me understand the variables and their relationships, identifying the most vulnerable states and when hospitals and clinics would need more medical staff.

[Rockbuster Stealth](https://github.com/vanessanunezp/Market_Research_Project){:target="_blank"} 

I conducted a market analysis to identify opportunities for a movie rental shop’s transition to an online service. I loaded all data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) to use SQL to analyze and answer ad-hoc business questions, from inventory to customer insights. To communicate my findings effectively, I transformed my SQL results into easy-to-consume visualizations with [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RockbusterMarket/Story1?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link){:target="_blank"}.

[GameCo](https://github.com/vanessanunezp/Video_Game_Popularity){:target="_blank"} 

An end-to-end analysis covering historical video game sales (1980-2016) to foster a better understanding of how a company's new games might fare in the market. I decided to run this analysis exclusively in Excel because the data set size was manageable.

Considering the industry's critical technical changes, I focused on the last two decades. However, I also decided to explore what have historically been the bestsellers of video games to facilitate the best actionable insights to plan better the marketing budget among regions to maximize return on investment.
