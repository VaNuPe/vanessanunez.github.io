### Projects

[Airbnb Berlin](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirbnbBerlin_17090407314950/AirbnbBerlin?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Market research for the most well-known company for short-term housing rentals utilizing supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and geospatial analysis with Python and Tableau.
The characteristics of this project required a deep understanding of Python and libraries such as Bokeh, Plotly, Dash, Folium, Geopandas, Geoplot, and scikit-learn. The scripts and visualizations created with Python are available for reference in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VaNuPe/Geospatial_Analysis_Project)
The development of this project was challenging and frustrating at times. Still, it is also an excellent example of the importance of cleaning and understanding the data as a starting point for every analysis.

[Instacart](https://github.com/VaNuPe/Ecommerce_Buying_Patterns_Project)

For this project, I conducted all the stages of my analysis to identify the correlation between customer buying behavior and e-commerce marketing strategy with Python in Jupyter Notebook, using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
One of the biggest challenges was the data set's size: more than 30 million rows. For some analysis and visualizations, I needed to sample the data to represent the entire population accurately.

[Influenza Season in the U.S.](https://public.tableau.com/views/RecommendationsfortheInfluenzaSeasoninU_S_/StaffPlan?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The goal of this project was strategically assign key medical staff ahead of the flu season using Excel, VLOOKUP, and Tableau for data visualization. All the process and the corresponding analysis and findings are consolidated in an Interim Report available for consultation in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/VaNuPe/Staffing_Distribution), and the final storyboard is in Tableau Public.
The big challenge of this project was integrating the different available data sets into one, mainly because the values were not uniform.

[Rockbuster Stealth](https://github.com/VaNuPe/Market_Research_Project)

I conducted a market analysis to identify opportunities for a movie rental shopâ€™s transition to an online service. I loaded all data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) to use SQL to analyze and answer ad-hoc business questions, from inventory to customer insights. To communicate my findings effectively, I transformed my SQL results into visualizations with [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RockbusterMarket/Story1?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

[GameCo](https://github.com/VaNuPe/Video_Game_Popularity)

An end-to-end analysis covering historical video game sales (1980-2016) to foster a better understanding of how a company's new games might fare in the market. I decided to run this analysis exclusively in Excel because the data set size was manageable, only 16,601 rows, and because it is a vital tool that a good analyst should be an expert in, too. The analysis and visualizations could be more impactful using Python or Tableau. Still, it is essential to have a solid understanding of this spreadsheet application and a working knowledge of its various formulas, functions, and data visualization capabilities.
