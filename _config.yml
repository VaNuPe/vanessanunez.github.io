description: I’m a Data Analyst with experience in machine learning and academic research. I have a strong analytical mind and a passion for storytelling. As an empathetic communicator, I translate complex information into creative and insightful presentations to engage a diverse audience effectively. I have worked for over six years developing a voice assistant that helps millions of customers daily. One of my proudest achievements was to solve biases and constraints in our projects with constructive feedback. Now, I am eager to use my expertise to deep dive analyses to provide clear observations so that people leaders can make more informed decisions.
